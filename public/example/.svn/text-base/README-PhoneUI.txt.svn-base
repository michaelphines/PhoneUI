This is an example of implementing a PhoneUI for an existing page.

The original Tetris game was downloaded from http://www.gosu.pl/tetris/ it is open source and is granted under a modified BSD license.  Thank you to author Cezary Tomczak for his work.  A couple liberal changes were made to the user interface.  In particular, the about page was not linked to through the PhoneUI.  I tried to make the copyright notice clearer by including it in place of the button.

The following scripts were added to load PhoneUI:

jquery.js          - The wonderful jQuery* library. 
swfobject.js       - Allows dynamic adding of SWF objects
mq.js              - AMQP for JavaScript/Flex by Dan Shepherd
jquery.phoneui.js  - The PhoneUI library
tetris.phoneui.js  - The PhoneUI extension for Tetris

* If you use Prototype or another library: http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries

Note: You may experience more significant latency on smart phones when your phone is set to play long DTMF tones.  If you can turn it off, great.  If you own an iPhone, complain to Apple.
